# MineExplosionDetection
This repository contains modules used to automate the collection, processing and analysis of data collected from gas sensors in order to calculate the explosibility of gas mixtures in underground mines. 
The modules are for 1. A Windows Forms Application created using C# and the .NET framework to provide a desktop interface 2. A website module created using Python and the Django framework for a graphical interface along with an Arduino program to run the microcontroller connected to the sensors and a python script to convert the collected data into the csv format
The repository also contains a document which explains the algorithms used to calculate gas mixture explosibility along with the structure of the software used.
